# Odoo Website & HTML Builder — Weekly Commit Digest (1–8 Oct 2025)
This digest covers all commits that touched the `addons/website`, `addons/html_builder`, and `addons/website_sale/static/src/website_builder` directories of the [Odoo community repository](https://github.com/odoo/odoo) between **1 and 8 October 2025** (UTC). The list was assembled on 8 Oct 2025 using the GitHub REST API with path filters for all three areas.
## Commit of the Week
- **[6c8a90e](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/6c8a90ecba45fb99addf1b86fe237fd626fba650)** — Introduces a high-level cache on `website.page` with granular opt-outs, dramatically reducing page render time while keeping dynamic pages safe.
## Highlights
- **Storefront performance wins.** Website now prefetches page fields, skips redundant ORM calls, and adds a configurable page cache, while Website Sale consolidates controller queries—together shaving hundreds of SQL calls off shop requests.
- **Navigation & UI reliability.** Menu auto-hide, header/footer visibility, dropdown selections, carousel controls, and footer animations all gained fixes so editors and visitors see consistent behaviour.
- **Builder stability & polish.** Builder option panes, CSS unit handling, iconography, image animations, and crash-prone reload paths were cleaned up, plus Safari-specific WebP messaging avoids silent regressions.
- **SEO & content safety nets.** Relative SEO cover URLs, resilient Open Graph images, pricelist block guards, and domain validation stop editors from tripping 500s.
- **Translations & tests.** Routine translation syncs landed throughout the week, and multiple tours/tests were refreshed so CI stays green.
