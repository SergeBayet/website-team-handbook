| 2025-09-30 | Basioni (basm) | [[IMP] voip: add internal link for call form view.](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/a9fe70b779354b8b54cf136859e8011442449e0d) | Task-4962728 |
| 2025-09-23 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[IMP] voip: move session-related methods from UserAgent to Session](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/64b82ad3aea568ed36759851a5a59a9a62091e0e) | The original VoIP code was written under the assumption that there would only ever be one session at a time. Consequently, much of the session state was stored in a global object called the UserAgent. |
| 2025-09-10 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[IMP] voip{,_onsip}: improve user preferences](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/b0047db6038977676762833dd8c765b66a4715de) | Task-5075195 |

| 2025-07-23 | aath-odoo | [[FIX] voip: prevent mobile keypad popup](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/a06c02e8e163ed052c1c4d25a56bea9b6409abde) | Purpose: When using the softphone keypad on mobile, pressing any key would automatically trigger the native keyboard, creating a frustrating user experience and making it tedious to dial numbers. |
| 2025-09-08 | Basioni (basm) | [[FIX] voip: rename userAgent.session to userAgent.activeSession in VoIP.](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/b61148ca7cf86ab9237e39e6304c889e612311e0) | This commit renames the missing values of `userAgent.session` to be `userAgent.activeSession`. This change was introduced in https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/pull/92315 |
| 2025-08-25 | akpu-odoo | [[FIX] voip:  remove should_auto_reject_incoming_calls functionality](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/d150beab39605034fcc7a849e3295cbef38fd924) | Removed the unnecessary auto-reject incoming calls functionality, as standard DND is already available. |
| 2025-09-08 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[IMP] voip_ai: improve demo data](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/19c2521f3d9e33059c47065bbc7deae5766490d2) | - Add explicit create_date to avoid having all the calls created at the same time - Remove useless country_id - Pick fictitious phone numbers that will allow the unambiguous computation of the related country |
| 2025-09-04 | Soumya M | [[FIX] voip_ai: demo data partner reference](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/bcf7918ad8abfeba151fe8b1312f8b2791b03725) | This commit removes unnecessarily added new partner references in demo data, and sets country_id to US in voip call demo data. |
| 2025-09-05 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[IMP] voip: set bitrate of audio recordings to 8 kbps](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/32a5273dcd15709534ff35704fac224320081b42) | This commit changes the bitrate of call recordings to 8 kbps. This change is intended to reduce the file size. A higher bitrate is not useful anyways, since most VoIP proivders use a similarly low bitrate. |
| 2025-08-13 | Basioni (basm) | [[IMP] voip: enhance VoIP transfer options.](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/4b24943e1f84be0964bc84d4154401a1feba7a56) | This commit introduces several new options to the transfer feature that already exists in VoIP. Those options are: 1. The user can choose between transferring the current call diretly to a chosen poterntial transferee or to ask them first (point 2). 2. The user is able to make another call to the potential transferee before making the transfer. 3. The user can switch between the two active call (the customer and the potential transferee) freely. 4. The user is able to terminate any call of the two calls while having the other one active. |
| 2025-09-02 | akpu-odoo | [[IMP] voip: add no-content help for call and provider views](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/cf346d6c3b43af3493ac3313234296f5c99cf22e) | This commit adds no-content guides to improve usability. |

However since the creating of the second (earlier) call was based on the absolute date, when the setUp took longer then anticipated the order was the opposite of the desired. |
| 2025-09-03 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[IMP] voip: /voip/get_country_code has no reason to be public](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/e15de641415ec8f9a33ea885c6c4a84afd7ceaed) | Change the authentication method of the /voip/get_country_code route from public to user. |
| 2025-09-01 | Basioni (basm) | [[IMP] voip: add successfuly tested providers' data in VoIP.](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/f4ce2f5b28d63c14f833f6539b6f4938045ff8c1) | This commit makes working providers more discoverable for users and ease the providers' configurations by adding those providers' data in VoIP be default. |
| 2025-08-28 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[IMP] voip{,_ai}: introduce Session class](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/ec9bcb28825457de9a9e0eb20a64fb6a73ce8769) | Introduce a Session class to hold the ever-growing amount of session-related logic. |
| 2025-07-24 | akpu-odoo | [[IMP] voip: automatically focus softphone when opening softphone.](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/7e01454c15f492a55230e150b84c87c7ffb90275) | This commit ensures the VoIP softphone is automatically focused when opened with keyborad shortcut. |
| 2025-08-07 | aath-odoo | [[IMP] voip: identify internal calls by extension](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/94d28d0580837626dbc78eb4f928b460a43fbd78) | Purpose: Improve the user experience by identifying internal calls made using extension numbers (voip usernames) by displaying the corresponding user's name. |
| 2025-08-28 | Romain Estievenart | [[FIX] voip_crm: add groups on session info](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/626bce64b5f0f3695238a81e1d8799ee2e65a61b) | Since the VoIP app use some groups at startup[1], it's made sense to adds it inside the session_info bundle to avoid RPCs at webclient startup. |
| 2025-08-26 | Soumya M | [[IMP] voip: harmonize call status](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/ee8b9d831aeb10a5d05d0cd7f0c6460f0a4d2a01) | Aim of this commit is to harmonize call status messages in voip.call and softphone history. |
| 2025-08-21 | Andrzej(pian) | [[IMP] voip_ai: Introduce backend tests](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/acb4d13cddf9705533c1797eba0812175fb10f24) | This commit introduces tests of "Backend Controller" and "Cron" parts of the following flow. |
| 2025-08-25 | Andrzej(pian) | [[IMP] voip_ai: Call from view shows transcription_status as a banner](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/c05e71b2a6dd559eadd4b91167ff84672a4a4acf) | Before this commit transcription_status was presented as a selection field on the voip.call form view. |
| 2025-08-25 | Andrzej(pian) | [[IMP] voip_ai: Added demo data](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/c4e3fe61a51dd22b3bf791c46691dc1d5eedf086) | With this commit we have a demo call in all of the transcription_status variations. |
| 2025-08-25 | Andrzej(pian) | [[IMP] voip_ai: Generate and display call's transcript summary](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/15a604c0109b3e56319c0cff580e423700fb6cc6) | This commit introduces the functionality to generate a one-liner summary for VoIP call transcripts. |
| 2025-08-25 | Andrzej(pian) | [[FIX] voip_ai: Ensure correct transcription status with error handling](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/3638ea0aa2db34935549195f363fb41ee3f7e77d) | Previously, if a call transcription request failed due to an oversized file, the `RequestEntityTooLarge` exception would cause the entire transaction to roll back. This meant that any attempt to set the `transcription_status` to an error state (e.g., "too_big_to_process") would be reverted, leaving the call in a "pending" state and obscuring the actual reason for failure. |
| 2025-08-28 | Basioni (basm) | [[FIX] voip_hr: fix voip_hr record rules.](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/72f1aaa050f2e86ad576d7c0fe920cbbaabb3aac) | This commit fixes the record rules that specifies the users that can read phone calls made through VoIP. Currently, managers can only access call records of their direct subordinates. They should have access also to calls made by employees that are managed by their direct subordinates. This commit fixes that. |
| 2025-08-27 | Basioni (basm) | [[IMP] voip: add simple calendar view for voip call.](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/24d69fcbfcfa2805548424c2a3426fd8bf8ec183) | Task-5043948 |
| 2025-08-22 | Basioni (basm) | [[IMP] voip: remove provider_id and company_id from voip.call](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/2657a5aea5dd9e39d9a79709d780d1aafe5583c8) | Task-5034202 |
| 2025-08-20 | Brieuc-brd | [[IMP] voip, voip_ai: finetune call statuses](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/97ec439bfe387a6ca32cf55b05a3175768ce196c) | This commit refines the design of the call statuses to ensure consistency across them. |
| 2025-08-08 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[IMP] voip{,_ai}: move the recording logic out of voip_ai](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/4af225403e4bb6e5618d528a286d4c453a5859cb) | The recording feature should be available even without AI installed. This commit moves the recording client code into a dedicated service, and polish the server side logic a bit. |
| 2025-08-08 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[REF] voip_ai: remove useless directories](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/0db63705e363fd1d746d2364670e10fcc1c4a47d) | Part-of: odoo/enterprise#92296 Signed-off-by: Louis Wicket (wil) &lt;wil@odoo.com&gt; |

| 2025-08-08 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[MOV] move ai_voip to voip_ai](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/0ccbddaf4934fff09db010d9c0f253d3fa9a2c84) | So that all modules extending VoIP follow the same naming convention. It also makes sense for the base module being extended to come first. |
| 2025-08-19 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[IMP] voip: rename VoIP to Phone](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/aac266d886a74987eb3bfef8454d0cd31a2f7bb1) | Task-4987530 |
| 2025-08-20 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[IMP] voip: show recent calls first in voip.call list view](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/da12b3c97a29e8b94a55c5bf7aa96ae981870434) | closes odoo/enterprise#92767 |
| 2025-07-24 | akpu-odoo | [[IMP] voip_crm: improve display logic of VoIP lead button.](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/d911dfd6992ddfb9ed5512c51b4f14e15f881767) | Previously, the lead button always displayed 'Lead' as its title, regardless of context. |
| 2025-08-19 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[IMP] voip_sms: change wording to use "text message" instead of "SMS"](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/353d630e188b200d5dcb9d6519dfad479ad704e9) | According to feedback, "SMS" is not a really common word in English. "Text message" is more frequent. |
| 2025-08-19 | akpu-odoo | [[FIX] voip:  fix incorrect error message on voip softphone](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/8b7c3f4d64f7585b2e7acc9eb7ed5c474253903b) | Previously, the error message shown to fix setting in general setting. |
| 2025-07-04 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[FIX] voip: avoid autofocus when typing](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/7e5da9b54e02c9b5a0c73b32dcee68d449ecd0ba) | Before switching the focus back to the softphone after a call, make sure the user isn't typing somewhere else. Only autofocus if the focus is not on an editable element. |
| 2025-08-05 | Andrzej(pian) | [[IMP] ai_voip: introduce per-provider transcription setting](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/df402bcdd9023157ee3661e453002bacb421384c) | Until now (after ref.1) call transcription was globally enabled by default once the `ai_voip` module was installed. The only way to prevent transcriptions (and sending data to external entities) was to uninstall the module entirely. |
| 2025-08-07 | Claire Nguyen (clan) | [[IMP] voip: change app icon](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/ec808436595b0884ea4f098f44976ee3bcbaddae) | This commit updates the voip png icon to the new one. |
| 2025-08-07 | Soumya M | [[IMP] voip: Removed create button from call list view](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/42356217ce25228adb1bb319d7ca3f0c20ce486f) | Purpose: Creating a new voip.call record from the backend should not be allowed. Since it is a log of the calls that are taking place via the widget. |
| 2025-08-05 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[FIX] voip: don't mix server and client values when computing time](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/7045b6e7732a19ff61bc6013476356a6db09d2bf) | It was reported that the timer for the call would sometimes start as a negative number. Examining the code that computes it suggests that the timestamp sent by the server was a few seconds in the future compared to luxon.DateTime.now() (client time). This discrepancy is most likely due to the clock skew between the client and the server. |
| 2025-08-05 | yhu-odoo | [[IMP] voip: do not allow editing dtmf result](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/d3c13ae01ebd61bea82bcfe05584d072abd0c63d) | The already sended DTMF signal can't be changed. In this commit, we ignore the useSelection effect when sending DTMF, user can only append new value to sended vulues. we also make the input readonly so that user can only send DTMF from the softphone keypad, since normally DTMF only support "123456789*0#" |
| 2025-07-30 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[IMP] voip: improve handling of invite failures](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/4f63bdf29289b2d712758546607b57a677079095) | If the PBX is not configured to use SRTP-DTLS, trying to invite a user in Odoo would result in rather obscure errors: - Chrome: Called with SDP without DTLS fingerprint - Firefox: Invalid description, no fingerprint attribute at level 0 |
| 2025-05-07 | Andrzej(pian) | [[ADD] ai_voip: end-to-end post-call recording & transcription](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/f96d1f4cc52c009a4f55cfaabf7b683bdf9e170d) | This commit makes the following flow possible: |
| 2025-07-14 | Basioni (basm) | [[IMP] *: add voip.call form view.](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/ad1a8d36b51a656ad973a0fbee1dca95ee490e6a) | *: voip, voip_{ crm, helpdesk, hr_recruitment, sale_subscription } |
| 2025-07-30 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[IMP] voip: don't show VoIP as the first app on the homepage](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/66c9a360c69d634b598f0bc507831bf0dde63c78) | Change the sequence id of the VoIP root menu so that it doesn't show up as the first app on the homepage. |
| 2025-07-16 | Soumya M | [[IMP] voip: show recent calls tab incase of missed calls](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/c995b7df3fc6ff541dc65d8b28661ab03f4a8c08) | Purpose: To open recent calls tab in softphone interface when there are missed calls. |
| 2025-07-07 | yhu-odoo | [[IMP] room,voip: adapt code for SharedWorker master tab election](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/97ef9e0a21c8ca083b2b3f8ff38421f048c7ed4d) | odoo/odoo#218332 introduced a new master tab election mechanism. Adapt enterprise code for it. |
| 2025-07-30 | Louis Wicket (wil) | [[FIX] voip: remove unused kwarg](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/338feaa92b4d7a4b132e4236eb1e7d99b004de3b) | "state" is no longer accepted as a kwarg of create_and_format, resulting in a crash when provided. |
| 2025-07-28 | aath-odoo | [[IMP] voip: improve input field visibility](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/8ea26c3823143fd54c223cc290ec1591941e95b9) | Purpose The main input field in the keypad widget was visually unclear, leading to confusion. Users often clicked near the field without realizing it, as there was no visible cursor or indication of focus. This change aims to make the input area more obvious and user-friendly. |
| 2025-07-28 | yhu-odoo | [[IMP] voip: clean session when call end](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/8f368d9a49df1dcf9530d0d7e73eae9437da94f6) | Instead of clean session in every function that can end a call, it's better that we do it when call model state is changed. |
| 2025-07-24 | Basioni (basm) | [[IMP] voip_{ crm, hr }: adapt security groups in voip_ bridge modules.](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/777ebe3918aacdfe3f09078f542e2a784f72a67f) | This commit improves the use of security groups in the bridge modules: `voip_hr` and `voip_crm` to use specific groups from `crm` and `hr` modules. |
| 2025-07-09 | Basioni (basm) | [[IMP] voip: integrate search bar component across softphone tabs](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/12072238db47ec8fe6e3708193e5962107569337) | This commit adds an expand button to the recent calls tab in the voip wizard so that the user can open the full list view of the recent calls. Also, it adds some predefined filters to the `voip.call` views. |

The call model now computes the duration and time slot based on the start date, and the user interface has been updated to include new menu items for better navigation. Additionally, tests have been added to ensure the correct computation of time slots during different seasons. |
| 2025-07-16 | akpu-odoo | [[IMP] voip: add hotkey and command palette entry for VoIP Softphone.](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/c40032b1d2aeffc8b6c174984a0b2c10b62eb5ce) | This commit adds a data hotkey and command palette entry for toggling the VoIP Softphone. |

So, this commit solves this by adding an "In call" status next to the voip icon when you are in a call. 2.

When trying to reject or accept the call, the lib crashes. This is a not so great fix that checks for that state of affairs and prevents the acception/rejection from happening. |

It also prevented the history from loading completely since additional lines were loaded on scroll, which didn't happen because no scroll bar would appear. |
| 2020-10-09 | Emilien Durieu (edu) | [[FIX] voip: mobile app crashing when missed calls](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/d22de08172b2df3671b463b6cf82bf01e356086a) | `_toggleFold` was calling `_onToggleDisplay` which was calling `_toggleDisplay` which in turn was calling `_toggleFold`, calling rpc procedure in the meantime, thus crashing both the server and the client. |

First of all, if you call someone which is already in an active call, the denied answer was not correctly interpreted on the "caller" side as the session was not cancelled. Now a message telling that the "callee" is not available is displayed and the session is cancelled. The second issue appears when the sip_ignore_incomming fields was activated. In this case, the call was always rejected. The problem is that the call may be redirected elsewhere, on a desk phone for e.g.. The previous solution does not allows this case. |
