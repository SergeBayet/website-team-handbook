        "body": "@dmo-odoo Sorry, forgot to send my answer. I don't know about finding an existing case but it's easy to create one: a non-savable area which contains an image with that class.\r\n\r\no_editable_media means that the image is editable, despite its **first** potential contenteditable=\"false\" ancestor. E.g. your team snippet case: the column that contains the image is not editable (because we don't want users to add text inside by mistake) but the image is. So we use a combination of contenteditable=\"false\" on the column and the o_editable_media class on the image (I guess you know all this since we decided it together).\r\n\r\nThen the `shouldEditableMediaBeEditable` is still necessary as a way to check that editing the image actually make sense: if it is *savable*. That function checks that the image is in a savable section.\r\n\r\nEasy to reproduce:\r\n- Add a team snippet in a page: see that the images are editable\r\n- Open the dev tools: inside one of the team member description, add `<t t-out=\"website.name\"/>`\r\n- Save the page (the website name appears in your member description)\r\n- Now re-enter edit mode: see that we now rightfully can still edit the images of the team members **except the one where there is the t-out** (well in theory it could but that's a limitation in this case, because the image column is marked as non editable in the first place).\r\n\r\nLOCO has been working on distinguishing the \"editable\" notion from the \"savable\" notion (and I thought his plan was to rename o_editable into o_savable, don't know). `shouldEditableMediaBeEditable` should probably have been named `shouldEditableMediaBeActuallyEditableBecauseItActuallyIsSavable` but it seemed too much :upside_down_face:  I preferred adding comments explaining why the function name is bad :upside_down_face: I guess I was not clear enough. But the \"savable\" notion is just a shortcut to explain it, my original code (which now changed to only support that \"savable\" notion I see :shrug:) was meant to support more. For example: simply a team snippet that was marked as not editable anymore thanks to the o_not_editable class so that some users don't break it (as we did in the past and probably still for some blocks on internal).",

I don't even know/remember why we have a  JS code adding the class in the first place (was it the case before 18.4?). But in any case, if it makes sense, it should surely not be conditional on the image being in a savable zone (at least not as an exception: it probably never make sense to edit a non-savable area, not just that particular class).\r\n\r\nThe steps to reproduce I sent you are actually the proof: we have images with the class, then the zone becomes unsavable... but the o_editable_media class will still be there and won't mean it is editable.\r\n\r\nAnother way to say it: if it was possible to do what you are saying (\"determine if the class should be added based on the environment\"), then we would not need the class at all.",

In any case, we always have been using `fa` on button directly, that's a case that is supposed to work. That's actually required by some layouts to work (as we have some rules targeting `.btn.fa`), at least that was the case a few days ago still.\r\n\r\nAnyways, you can choose to use the inner `<i>` if you prefer and it works but just adding `role=\"img\"` is not enough then. The button needs a `title` either way and if you use `role=\"img\"` it probably requires an `aria-label` on the icon itself... which IMO is just useless info that pollute the DOM for no reason. From an accessibility point of view, I think an user would just prefer to know there is a button with a certain function (title) and not having to know there is a picture which is an icon that says the same thing... but I might be wrong :shrug: ",

And having website.page records for dynamic stuff will probably always be a valid usecase and it's probably widely used in customization (it's actually a very common request to be able to add dynamic things in website.page without losing full edition capabilities).\r\n\r\nNote that there is also an old task (still not merged this year) about allowing translating URL too. Your check would fail in that case too.\r\n\r\nWould be nice if everything that is existing but unknown by some people is not immediately judged as useless or stupid, just saying... :shrug: Anyways, that's the last website-related PR where I'll be annoying, hopefully :+1: \r\n\r\nMaybe there is a way here to somehow rely on the `key` of the website.page's view?

To review, in the end I went with the original idea of just changing the path in font CSS files and just stopped using the os.path/Path lib.\r\n- Regrouped the two font bundles into one... actually there are some apps that include one without the other or the fontawesome one without its override (meaning twitter icons are still twitter instead of X, etc), it would fix all of this.\r\n- Split the work in two in the end (also it was missing an enterprise adaptation): I moved the change in app bundles (and its enterprise part) to https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/225760. I am not confident enough to merge a change in all apps that close to the OXP for a minor improvement. In this PR here, I only kept the change for the frontend asset bundle.\r\n- Found out that the font preload does not work: it preloads the font asset file with the website ID in the URL... while the font asset file URL added in the CSS is not using the website id (so the browser actually loads the font twice) :grimacing: ... can't seem to find a fix, I don't know this code enough to fix that quickly :cry: \r\n\r\nI'll try to merge this before the OXP after more careful testing, as a first step before the mentioned PR follow-up for all apps. Unfortunately, @bso-odoo is on leave until next Friday. We'll see if I can check with him to do that at that moment. Or find the time to deeply review and fix this on my own.",

I am guessing it depends on the container display, it's probably flex here and it works in other places where it's not flex? But then you are only fixing it for this one while it should work for all flex containers. Actually with a bit of research I found this: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/14bcdbc6f541b573a2de7b639fde27f3751c9b49 -> it was probably fixing the alignment option when the container is flex... but probably left the link case broken.\r\n\r\nAlso I don't think that forcing 100% width is actually good: it means that clicking around the image also follow the invisible link.\r\n\r\nThe solution is probably about making the link adapt according to the alignment option somehow. The ideal way would be using display:contents on the link and be done with it, but that probably does not work on all browsers and screen readers.\r\n\r\nI let you investigate.",
