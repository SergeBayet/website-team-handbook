Just curious
- **review** (2025-09-26T11:59:00Z): Thanks for checking
- **review_comment** (2025-10-02T15:16:38Z): @dmo-odoo Sorry, forgot to send my answer. I don't know about finding an existing case but it's easy to create one: a non-savable area which contains an image with that class.

o_editable_media means that the image is editable, despite its **first** potential contenteditable="false" ancestor. E.g. your team snippet case: the column that contains the image is not editable (because we don't want users to add text inside by mistake) but the image is. So we use a combination of contenteditable="false" on the column and the o_editable_media class on the image (I guess you know all this since we decided it together).

Then the `shouldEditableMediaBeEditable` is still necessary as a way to check that editing the image actually make sense: if it is *savable*. That function checks that the image is in a savable section.

Easy to reproduce:
- Add a team snippet in a page: see that the images are editable
- Open the dev tools: inside one of the team member description, add `<t t-out="website.name"/>`
- Save the page (the website name appears in your member description)
- Now re-enter edit mode: see that we now rightfully can still edit the images of the team members **except the one where there is the t-out** (well in theory it could but that's a limitation in this case, because the image column is marked as non editable in the first place).

LOCO has been working on distinguishing the "editable" notion from the "savable" notion (and I thought his plan was to rename o_editable into o_savable, don't know). `shouldEditableMediaBeEditable` should probably have been named `shouldEditableMediaBeActuallyEditableBecauseItActuallyIsSavable` but it seemed too much :upside_down_face:  I preferred adding comments explaining why the function name is bad :upside_down_face: I guess I was not clear enough. But the "savable" notion is just a shortcut to explain it, my original code (which now changed to only support that "savable" notion I see :shrug:) was meant to support more. For example: simply a team snippet that was marked as not editable anymore thanks to the o_not_editable class so that some users don't break it (as we did in the past and probably still for some blocks on internal).
- **review_comment** (2025-10-06T12:02:24Z): > The fix I am suggesting would only put the class on images that are "savable", that is the ones having a closest('.o_editable')

That's impossible, as the whole point of the class is to declare an image as editable in a non-editable sub-area, in a savable zone. I don't even know/remember why we have a  JS code adding the class in the first place (was it the case before 18.4?). But in any case, if it makes sense, it should surely not be conditional on the image being in a savable zone (at least not as an exception: it probably never make sense to edit a non-savable area, not just that particular class).

The steps to reproduce I sent you are actually the proof: we have images with the class, then the zone becomes unsavable... but the o_editable_media class will still be there and won't mean it is editable.

Another way to say it: if it was possible to do what you are saying ("determine if the class should be added based on the environment"), then we would not need the class at all.
- **review_comment** (2025-10-06T12:47:41Z): Ok, I spoke a bit with @loco-odoo : I kinda forgot the system changed but still:

- Either we base the new system on adding the `o_editable_media` class automatically during edit mode only, in which case you either have to:
  - Ignore existing databases that had the class saved (never fan of that) and the errors that come with them in the new system
  - Upgrade scripts
  - Remove the class everywhere when entering edit mode
- Or we live with both systems at the same time, in which case the `shouldEditableMediaBeEditable` check is still required**


** living with both system is what I recommend for `o_not_editable` for example as it is way older, an easy way for people to declare non editable zone and just an extra selection in the "non editable element selector list" (without any associated code like `shouldEditableMediaBeEditable`, hopefully)

## PR #228575
URL: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/228575

- **review_comment** (2025-10-06T15:25:58Z): In stable we generally avoid changing attribute values. If someone currently sells your fix as a custo, he might create a view that xpaths `//div[data-selector=".o_wcrm_filters_top"]`, which would later crash if the app is updated.

Also, nobody would get this fix in 17.0 as they would need to -u.

There are two other workarounds:
- Using `_patchForComputeSnippetTemplates`, but when it's about *changing* an attribute, it's not the best.
- Using `_computeWidgetVisibility` (possibly combined to `_patchForComputeSnippetTemplates` to add a data-name if no other ways to differentiate the widget via `params`).

In 19.0, as this became static XML, this would at least ease adding the potentially required data-name, but I still think we should get more careful about *changing attribute values* (even in static XML) when there are ways to avoid it easily as the more Odoo will be used, the more that kind of custom xpath will get likely :grimacing:

- You could also remove the title on those button... it's the same as the text, which is just annoying for no reason.
- **review_comment** (2025-09-17T13:38:52Z): In this case, `role="img"` could be the right one... but not if no aria-label or title. IMO I would:
- Add a `title` on the `<button>`
- Remove the `<i>` and use the `oi` class on the button itself as before (does not that work?)
- **review_comment** (2025-09-23T13:54:49Z): > IMO using the icon classes on the button itself makes it clearer that the icon serves as the buttonâ€™s label.

Exactly... that's what I am asking?

> It also lets us specify its role

That's contradicting :thinking: I guess the first part of your sentence meant the opposite, in which case this is just wrong: `<button class="fa fa-home"/>` is way more clear than `<button><i class="fa fa-home/></button>`: you don't have to analyze the button's content and other attributes to know if there is text or if the structure/roles are right: the button is using the fa class, it is a button with an icon only.

> and prevents styles from .oi to maybe conflict with .btn.

What style could conflict? `oi` is defined afterwards and any `hover` or anything else should style apply, no? In any case, we always have been using `fa` on button directly, that's a case that is supposed to work. That's actually required by some layouts to work (as we have some rules targeting `.btn.fa`), at least that was the case a few days ago still.

Anyways, you can choose to use the inner `<i>` if you prefer and it works but just adding `role="img"` is not enough then. The button needs a `title` either way and if you use `role="img"` it probably requires an `aria-label` on the icon itself... which IMO is just useless info that pollute the DOM for no reason. From an accessibility point of view, I think an user would just prefer to know there is a button with a certain function (title) and not having to know there is a picture which is an icon that says the same thing... but I might be wrong :shrug:

And the fact this is implemented as a website.page comes with other advantages (e.g. the possibility to control the header position). Even if we are planning to review models and things in the future to improve all of that (urls, page options, etc), that's not the case yet. And having website.page records for dynamic stuff will probably always be a valid usecase and it's probably widely used in customization (it's actually a very common request to be able to add dynamic things in website.page without losing full edition capabilities).

Note that there is also an old task (still not merged this year) about allowing translating URL too. Your check would fail in that case too.

Would be nice if everything that is existing but unknown by some people is not immediately judged as useless or stupid, just saying... :shrug: Anyways, that's the last website-related PR where I'll be annoying, hopefully :+1: 

Maybe there is a way here to somehow rely on the `key` of the website.page's view? That will be somewhat more robust.

Actually, Weblate was not communicated, right? It was communicated through the Transifex platform and I saw it over there and I communicated it to the website team but I don't think we actually got a RD email for that one? :upside_down_face:

> We include demo data

That might have been it, I probably tested without them.

> The auto-export does not keep the old terms [...] This is partially why the translation documentation

When it was non-avoidable (e.g. a documentation being entirely wrong in settings because Google changed something and replaced by something new), we actually kept the removed terms in the .pot file that we exported manually (and only commited the added terms). That way translations would not be wiped in outdated database that would still have the outdated XML for some reasons. But of course, that's supposed to be rare and I guess we could just keep the outdated XML in display:none or something like that now, which would be more stable anyway.

Thanks for the details :+1:
- **review_comment** (2025-10-08T13:52:43Z): > because there were 2 msgid/msgstr's for the same email template (i.e. model term) in the pot file when only 1 is expected

Not sure what you mean; for example for a specific website view that's a whole lot of the same "model term" with different msgid.

```
#. module: website
#: model_terms:ir.ui.view,arch_db:website.snippets
msgid "AAA"
msgstr ""

#. module: website
#: model_terms:ir.ui.view,arch_db:website.snippets
msgid "BBB"
msgstr ""
```

If we somehow removed the use of AAA and added the use of CCC, we would just commit


```
#. module: website
#: model_terms:ir.ui.view,arch_db:website.snippets
msgid "AAA"
msgstr ""

#. module: website
#: model_terms:ir.ui.view,arch_db:website.snippets
msgid "BBB"
msgstr ""

#. module: website
#: model_terms:ir.ui.view,arch_db:website.snippets
msgid "CCC"
msgstr ""
```

(without removing AAA, which should just have no effect in new database, while still being on Transifex and used in translation of old databases).

But true, I did not test this was still working, I did not hear of any broken thing because of it (but of course it's not like we did that every week nor even every month). Anyways, that way I know in that rare case, I have to try not removing the outdated part of the XML.

> It doesn't affect R&D though

True, just a bit when someone explains how translations work to newbies and they would incorrectly mention Transifex :wink: Anyways I was not saying you specifically should communicate about it, just that we should have a place for that kind of news (even in Guru meetings I don't remember it was even mentioned  :upside_down_face:)

Maybe we should have the same as for the label: not adding the "parallax" in keywords automatically but by hand... but since all the keyword are put together in a translated sentence as a whole, this is not possible with the current system (we would need RDE's work of a "snippet model" that FP did not want). Also I am sure "parallax" could be used in keywords, not speaking about the parallax options, e.g. the custom s_announcement_scroll parallax.

Anyways, not important.

I don't see that change either?

Note that we changed to a clearly-unmistakable logo image in the past instead of image of "image followed by text", because some users were trying to edit the text not understand this was an image. I don't think it was a big issue... but so you know. I prefer the new logo too but it will clearly recreate that old problem, maybe you can find a compromise.

- **review** (2025-09-05T16:35:12Z): I was hoping to merge this today or over the weekend but unfortunately I think this will wait as there is at least one remaining issue, and I have trouble reviewing this correctly on my own without losing a week :grimacing: Credit to @bso-odoo for having done this that quickly though, as a last-minute request.

What I did here:
- Squashed all commits
- Handled all the comments of JUC
- Handled the comment of XMO (hopefully). To review, in the end I went with the original idea of just changing the path in font CSS files and just stopped using the os.path/Path lib.
- Regrouped the two font bundles into one... actually there are some apps that include one without the other or the fontawesome one without its override (meaning twitter icons are still twitter instead of X, etc), it would fix all of this.
- Split the work in two in the end (also it was missing an enterprise adaptation): I moved the change in app bundles (and its enterprise part) to https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/225760. I am not confident enough to merge a change in all apps that close to the OXP for a minor improvement. In this PR here, I only kept the change for the frontend asset bundle.
- Found out that the font preload does not work: it preloads the font asset file with the website ID in the URL... while the font asset file URL added in the CSS is not using the website id (so the browser actually loads the font twice) :grimacing: ... can't seem to find a fix, I don't know this code enough to fix that quickly :cry: 

I'll try to merge this before the OXP after more careful testing, as a first step before the mentioned PR follow-up for all apps. Unfortunately, @bso-odoo is on leave until next Friday. We'll see if I can check with him to do that at that moment. Or find the time to deeply review and fix this on my own.

handled the fix in the `media_dialog_legacy` version of the image
selector.)

There are two problems with this:
- You mention the development commit, not the one which was actually merged. Find the proper one in the main branch. You can easily find it by using the pull request dashboard, by clicking on the first message's image of robodoo on the PR in 18.0:
<img width="570" height="448" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6a325ee-a930-4840-a4e5-bda16d058042" />
- You use a 7-chars hash, which will likely trigger a collision in a few years. I'd suggest you use a full link with a full hash, which allows developers to actually click on the link from their IDE:

And RDE and JKE have done many things to keep that query count as low as possible, even if from a practical point of view we would probably most of the time prefer simplicity over SQL query optimization but... :shrug:

Would it be possible for you to check if you can restore the old cache system we had for website.page at least? Not only I was never an expert regarding that part but also I have quite a few things to review at the moment myself :hot_face: 

FYI: FP is actually pinging me at this very moment about micro-optimizations so... kinda funny you are asking me to increase the SQL query count at the same time :upside_down_face:
- **review_comment** (2025-09-02T06:01:32Z): FYI:

I tested this morning based on a fresh master with https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/197296 merged (which I guess was related when it comes to the performance of serving pages?), I have similar results: +~30-50% time per request for website.page records.

Is it critical? I don't know, probably not... but it's obviously less good: again, I was not a fan of t-cache, but we should then restore the cache we had for website pages (that was removed when t-cache was introduced) or something similar.

Anyways, the "circular avoidance" thing that is explained in the commit message does not work at all... I guess we'll need some more code testing to ensure it stays fixed once you'll fix it.

<img width="560" height="125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef6017b3-af28-4e7b-b5b0-77db4740b44c" />

Functionally, if it was up to me, I would not make a line of code about this. But @lebl-odoo wants a complete check about it: preventing to create a circular dependency on any level (so even the 5th ancestor :shrug:), because indeed, the user do not have the possibility to see the full tree so it might be better to ensure the tree is not "broken".

So this PR will need some rework and as it introduces new fields, I guess we'll skip 19.0 and target 19.1 as the freeze is about to happen (this was already not sure it would land in 19.0 even if I r+'ed now). I'll stop my review here, we'll make it happen in 19.1.

But let's not pile on the problem: that step is not supposed to be shown to users... and I am not sure how it works in the new system of tours. I was thinking there was a `isActive` key or something like that, but maybe it was changed to be automatic for steps that have no `run`? (like the first step here actually). Could you confirm me that? :pray:
- **review_comment** (2025-09-03T08:34:22Z): In my theme repo review I said:
>  It could be automatic in the registerThemeHomepageTour function definition in website?

Here you don't do that: you only change the definition of the tour for the community repo. You still have to change it automatically for all themes tours (did you run the theme test to confirm it actually checks the bug is solved? I don't think it does... if you run the `test_02_homepage_tour_every_theme` without your CSS change in the themes, it probably passes because it still does not test going to the theme tab on all themes)

So here I am thinking about actually changing the `registerThemeHomepageTour` function itself, to actually add the `goToTheme` steps at the end automatically.

Not only the "homepage" purpose was removed without so much of a thought but we kept calling prepend_trigger but removing the prepend text? Damn...

Anyways, removing `prepend_trigger` entirely (especially keeping the function as dead code (although in stable, that's normal)) is not perfect. I think we should restore the prepend_trigger use. That's actually what was checking that we indeed are on the homepage while the tour run no? :grimacing: That might not be critical for the tour *test* but if we do restore the user tour as we should... we don't want to the tour to build a homepage just anywhere I think.

I'll split this commit in two: you are doing different things in the same commit. I'll add a comment about the prepend and I'll create a follow-up task for handling that.

- **review_comment** (2025-08-21T15:08:36Z): Should not we ensure that `this.state.unsplashRecords` never contains duplicates in the first place? Or is it already the case and you just want to convert to a set?

- **review_comment** (2025-08-21T15:26:04Z): Based on my comments, I would go with something like this, if I understood things right:

```javascript
const existingIds = this.state.unsplashRecords.map(existing => existing.id);
const newImages = images.filter((record, index, arr) => {
    // Ignore duplicates from previous searches
    return !existingIds.includes(record.id))
        // Unsplash can actually return duplicate in the same batch, make
        // sure to drop those too.
        && arr.indexOf(record) === index);
});

Regarding a potential test addition as you were asking, well, that would be better to have one but I am not the most regarding when it comes to tests addition for such corner cases including a library. If you were to write a test, then the test should not call unsplash anyway: you would have to mock the actual unsplash search. E.g., in a tour, patch the Unsplash class to not make a RPC but simulate a result with a duplicated entry.

You are actually fixing more than that:
- Drop an text-image snippet
- Replace the image by a PNG image
=> It is converted to WebP but you don't get the quality option :open_mouth: 

Maybe you could precise that in the commit message while at the same time make the fix available for users that don't update? I think you can replace the TODO part in _renderCustomXML to instead add the missing data-name on the element that you already search with `we-range[data-set-quality]` in fact. Instead of removing it. Or we have also `_patchForComputeSnippetTemplates` for that purpose (but not needed just to add the data-name in an existing option like in this case). Note that in 18.4+, you'll be able to change the XML directly and that's it since it's now static XML :)

- the tour registration takes a function that returns the steps, I always guess the point was to allow overrides more easily no? That something could be extended **before** that function is called.

So can't it work by:
- exporting `SUB_SNIPPET_TEMPLATES`
- other apps add things inside that
- The use of `SUB_SNIPPET_TEMPLATES` is made **into the function that return the tour steps**.

- **review_comment** (2025-08-12T09:48:51Z): I am not sure why this would be a specific problem of the image gallery block. In other cases, how does it magically works? I am guessing it depends on the container display, it's probably flex here and it works in other places where it's not flex? But then you are only fixing it for this one while it should work for all flex containers. Actually with a bit of research I found this: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/14bcdbc6f541b573a2de7b639fde27f3751c9b49 -> it was probably fixing the alignment option when the container is flex... but probably left the link case broken.

Also I don't think that forcing 100% width is actually good: it means that clicking around the image also follow the invisible link.

The solution is probably about making the link adapt according to the alignment option somehow. The ideal way would be using display:contents on the link and be done with it, but that probably does not work on all browsers and screen readers.

I let you investigate.
- **review_comment** (2025-08-18T10:44:37Z): As I explained in details, the current solution is not good:
1. It fixes a generic problem (all images in a flex environment have the same issues) in a very specific way (only in the CSS for the gallery snippet)
2. It is functionally not great: if I have a 50x50 image I don't want the whole carousel to be a link

This should rather be about adapting the link / alignment options to adapt the link element properly.

... but the minimum would be to make o_cc1 behave like not o_cc at all. Reminder: the o_cc1 class only purposes are:
- Be able to reforce color preset 1 inside another colored contained
- Force the o_cc1 background above the default body background image

So the base definition of `.o_dot` should include the right color forcing, base on a bootstrap variable (I guess `$primary` or something like that).

- **review_comment** (2025-08-18T17:17:15Z): > start loop from 2

Why? You break the "Be able to reforce color preset 1 inside another colored contained" part of my explanation if you do that.

Have a snippet (A) which contains your timeline snippet (B). Add o_ccX to A, and o_cc1 to B => you get the dot color of o_ccX and nothing from the inner o_cc1.

- **review_comment** (2025-09-11T11:49:34Z): I don't understand why this PR would need to change this function
- **review_comment** (2025-09-11T11:49:46Z): General question before reviewing further: do we really need to change the js <-> python communication for this feature? Can't we track things that are being changed on the client side only (when the JS function calling those python controllers are called)?

It seems weird to say on the client side:

- Hey python, change from x to y, and tell me what changed
- ... well it was x, now it is y
- Ok I'll know I have to revert to x

While you could just say
- Hey python, change from x to y, I'll remember it was x

- **review_comment** (2025-07-31T09:07:12Z): `t-attf-` are normally translated: if not, that's the bug that should be fixed here
- **review** (2025-07-31T09:12:06Z): Most of those moves to the JS are annoying IMO. To avoid having to jump between the JS and the XML just to see some labels, I would rather:
- Use `t-attf-` when you can
- Use a `t-set` otherwise

But if someone prefers to go fast and merge like this, that's fine by me too.

URL: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/221202

- **review_comment** (2025-08-20T11:30:11Z): I don't like the `fully_editable` name, I'd go with a simpler `is_designer` (in that order: `editable = is_designer = ...`). That way the condition a few lines below will be `if editable and is_designer:` rather than `if fully_editable and editable:` which looks weird.

Or `has_group_designer` to do like the variable below, as you prefer.

- **review_comment** (2025-08-20T11:44:52Z): Not sure about those steps:
- Is the first step required given the fact that the second one just checks it's not o_editable?
- Dirty has nothing to do with this test

I would go with an unique step like this:
`iframe :has(.o_editable) footer:not(.o_editable):not(:has(.o_editable))` => this is the most robust way to write this I think, independently from where the `o_editable` class might end up:
- it ensures the check is only done when one o_editable has been added somewhere
- It checks the non-presence of `o_editable` anywhere in the `footer` tag

- **review_comment** (2025-09-22T13:23:03Z): Could you mention in the commit message what you are trying to fix (ideally, steps to reproduce the issue)? The community does not have access to opening the task :upside_down_face: And without opening the task, I lost some time trying to check how it affects popup buttons... well it does not :upside_down_face:
- **review_comment** (2025-09-22T13:33:30Z): From what I see, bootstrap has this:
```scss
@mixin btn-close-white() {
  filter: var(--#{$prefix}btn-close-white-filter);
}

.btn-close-white {
  @include btn-close-white();
}
```

1. I think the minimum would be using their mixin, that will be more robust to future bootstrap lib changes. But maybe it's even better to do `@extend .btn-close-white;` (while I normally don't recommend extending non-placeholder selector, it seems quite controled here). I let you choose :+1: 

2. Instead of `unset` being repeated for potentially all 5 cc classes, put the rule in the `.o_cc {` CSS rules, that's the point of those ;) And that will later be further optimized with task-3770405
- **review_comment** (2025-09-24T11:27:50Z): - `unset` for o_cc
- `filter` (or not, depending on `$-bg-color`) for o_ccX
